Learning Systems Inc. (LSI) is the largest online educational provider on complementary alternative
medicine (CAM) and Bible content.
Its rich market niche, characterized by corporate clients with large budgets, significant training needs
 and
receptiveness to new technology, include Healthcare Providers, Academic institutions, Multilevel Network
Marketing and Manufacturing Companies, Alternative Health Industries, Christian Seminaries and Clergy.
LSI delivers its unique CAM content via Internet-based courses on CLEGA Universityâ„¢, its full-service,
centrally hosted, scalable remote proprietary virtual campus.
Its leadership position is based upon one of the largest CAM and Bible content library ever assembled.
Developed by the Founders over a period of 22 years of research, the library includes over 180,000
proprietary abstracts, 704 disease monographs, 71 trace mineral and 22 amino acid monographs, 500
Nutritional/Herbal Therapeutic Remedy Monographs and 1100 Bible study courses. Founders themselves
collectively have over 54 years experience in creating courses and books for the CAM market.
Modern technology has made possible to gather and present this information economically and efficiently
and LSI is leading the effort to marry technology and information dissemination through three strategic
technology alliances which allow to register, enroll, teach, test, grade and certify distance learners 
in a seamless fashion.
LSI is focusing its resources in the CAM and Bible e-learning business. E-learning is in fact the 
fastestgrowing and most promising market in the education industry and corporate e-learning is expected
 to top $7
billion by 2002, according to WR Hambrecht  Co.
By continuously developing and expanding its CAM and Bible database, relentlessly streamlining the
process of delivering content and widening the range and variety of its e-learning educational products,
 LSI
intends to maintain and strengthen its leadership position in this lucrative market niche while creating
significant B2B and e-commerce opportunities.
Exploiting the latter to their fullest potential is a natural evolution for LSI: E-Train-the Trainer 
revenues,
portal development revenues, e-mail marketing fees , royalty commissions on sales (vitamins, herbs, skin
care products, DVDs  video, magazines, newsletters, religious books) will provide a significant
complementary revenue stream for the company that will increase market share, promote name recognition,
and maximize efficiency.
