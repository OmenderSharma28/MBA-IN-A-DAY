After attaining the highest growth rate in 2000 for more than a decade, the world economy
experienced a sharp downturn over the last quarter of 2000 and into the new year.  The principal
factors behind this reversal and near-term economic prospects were examined in Trade and
Development Report, 2001, issued in April, on the basis of preliminary data available for the first
quarter of 2001.  Based on an analysis of underlying imbalances and fragilities in the world economy,
the UNCTAD secretariat argued that without a coordinated global policy response, the slowdown in
the United States would produce a synchronous cyclical downturn in the world economy.  Rather than
a rapid rebound, the United States economy could experience a prolonged period of sluggish growth
which even quick conventional policy actions might be unable to remedy.  The Report also suggested
that even Europe could be much more vulnerable to the slowdown in the United States than was
generally expected by policy makers in the region, and without a determined change in economic policy,
European growth would fall substantially below the 3 per cent experienced in the previous year.
Similarly, without more aggressive measures designed to reverse persistent deflation, Japanâ€™s recovery
remained highly fragile.  If all these risks became reality, there would be a sharp deterioration in the
external trading environment of developing countries, many of which were struggling to re-establish
conditions for rapid and sustained growth after recent bouts of financial crisis.  While some emerging
markets were expecting to improve their performance as a result of lower United States interest rates
and a weaker dollar, these benefits could be easily wiped out by reassessment of risks, rising risk
spreads and falling capital inflows brought about by slowdown in global growth and a further round of
uncertainty.
Already on the eve of events of 11 September, global economic conditions had been
deteriorating over a year.  The decline in the pace of demand in the first half of 2001 had been sharper2
than expected and for the first time since the late 1970s much of the world economy was simultaneously
experiencing slower growth (table 1).  The slowdown in the major industrial countries had begun to
affect the rest of the world through trade and financial linkages, and many economies in Asia and Latin
America were confronting recessionary pressures.  Until the events of September 11, however, policy
makers in most major industrial countries were reluctant to adopt a coordinated approach to stabilizing
and reviving the world economy.  But the recent events that have made possible such a coordinated
macroeconomic policy response have also made the world economy more fragile and unpredictable.
